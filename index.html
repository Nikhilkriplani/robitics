            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>The word robot can refer to both physical robots and virtual software agents, but the latter are usually
                referred to as bots.[11] There is no consensus on which machines qualify as robots but there is general
                agreement among experts, and the public, that robots tend to possess some or all of the following
                abilities and functions: accept electronic programming, process data or physical perceptions
                electronically</p>

                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>The idea of automata originates in the mythologies of many cultures around the world. Engineers and
                    inventors from ancient civilizations, including Ancient China,[14] Ancient Greece, and Ptolemaic
                    Egypt,[15] attempted to build self-operating machines, some resembling animals and humans. Early
                    descriptions of automata include the artificial doves of Archytas</p>

            <h2 class="irritate">Early robots</h2>
            <p>In 1928, one of the first humanoid robots, Eric, was exhibited at the annual exhibition of the Model
                Engineers Society in London, where it delivered a speech. Invented by W. H. Richards, the robot's frame
                consisted of an aluminium body of armour with eleven electromagnets and one motor powered by a
                twelve-volt power source.</p>
